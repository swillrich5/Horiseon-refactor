# Horiseon-refactor

The objective of the Horiseon-refactor (homework #1) is to refactor the HTML so that it's more accessible.  In addition, fix any broken links, add comments to both the HTML and CSS, create a README.md file (this file), push the website code to a remote GitHub repository, and deploy the updated site.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

More specifically:
 - Add semantic HTML elements to make the HTML more accessible such as header, article, footer, content, etc.
 - HTML is structured well
 - Add alt tags to each img tag to describe each image, making it more accessible
 - Add a descriptive title that is displayed in the tab of the web page.  I've also added a favicon to make the page tab more pleasing
 - Add comments to explain the HTML and CSS including comments to point out changes
 
 Outside of the actual HTML:
 - Put the code in a remote GitHub repository
 - Deploy the application at live URL: publish from GitHub
 - Make sure the application deploys with no errors
 - Submit the GitHub URL: put the URL in Boot Camp Spot homework
 - Create README.md file (this file) that includes
